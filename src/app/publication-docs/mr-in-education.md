abstract: "Mixed Reality (MR) is an emerging immersive technology that has the potential to assist and support the teaching and learning process in the field of education. MR has seen its uses in fields such as engineering and architecture to assist in visualising complex models and run simulations directly on the real world. However, MR has yet to see a widespread usage in the field of education and training. In a campus setting, one of the most common type of education and training that is available to everyone regardless of their background is the fire safety education, thus this project aimed at investigating the use of Mixed Reality technology in the field of education and training through the Fire Safety Training (FST) application. The project has produced an MR FST application that can be used in a Microsoft HoloLens2 headset. To achieve the aim of the project, a formal study was conducted with volunteer participants. This study has investigated how MR-based learning could offer more benefits for learners when compared to a traditional learning setting. Additionally, user experience (UX) were also investigated to obtain insights regarding how users view and perceive the FST MR application. The findings from this study were then used to provide recommendations on the implementation of MR in Education."
