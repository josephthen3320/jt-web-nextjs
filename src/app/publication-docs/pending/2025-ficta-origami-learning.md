description: 'This study explores how sensed metrics and VARK learning preferences (Visual, Aural, Read/Write, Kinesthetic) relate to creating aesthetically pleasing origami, finding that Visual learners perform best. Multimodal learners (high in all VARK categories) show greater mental and physical engagement, leading to better short- and long-term performance, with EEG-measured mental activity being the strongest predictor of success.'
