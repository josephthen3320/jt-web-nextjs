*Meow World!*

Welcome to the chaotic, caffeine-fueled corner of the internet where randomness reigns and cats are the unofficial mascots.

Here, I (sometimes) dive into whatever interests me at a given time, maybe tinker with VR/MR in Unity, and occasionally ~~try to take over the world~~ lose myself in the endless React components. 
But it's not all structured code and polished projects; this is a space for experimentation, unexpected ideas, and embracing the beautiful mess of creativity.

From debugging disasters to spontaneous feline-inspired tangents, this is where chaos meets curiosity. 
Whether you're here for the tech, the cats, or just the vibes, I'm glad you stopped by.

Let's embrace the chaos together - because sometimes, the best ideas come from the most random of thoughts.
