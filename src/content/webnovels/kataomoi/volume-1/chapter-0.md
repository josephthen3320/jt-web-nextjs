“I just needed you to know,” 

I said, not looking up. 

Her silence didn’t fall like thunder—it fell like snow. 

Quiet, cold, and slow to melt.


She didn’t answer right away. 
The silence stretched, thick and suffocating, like the pause before a storm. 
My heart pounded in my ears, and I could almost hear the rhythm of my breath against the beating pulse of the world.


I glanced up at her, but she wasn’t looking at me. 

Her gaze was somewhere far off, distant like a horizon I could never reach. 
I thought I saw a flicker in her eyes—a hesitation, maybe, but it disappeared before I could be sure.

“I don’t expect anything from this,” 

I added quickly, trying to swallow the lump that had formed in my throat. 


"I just... had to say it. For me."

The words hung there, unanswered. 

Her lips parted, but only a breath escaped, not a reply. 
And in that moment, I knew. 
The space between us had changed, but not in the way I’d hoped.

I wanted to reach out, to pull the words back, but I couldn’t. 

— It was too late.

Her gaze finally met mine. 
It wasn’t the look I wanted, but it wasn’t the rejection I’d feared either. 

It was something softer. 

Something quieter.

— And it stung.

“I...” 

She didn’t finish, only looked away again, the words unspoken and hanging in the air, fragile like glass.

The silence returned—wiser now, heavier.

I stood there, waiting for something—anything—that might mend the crack that had just split the moment in two. A smile. A word. A breath of hope. But nothing came.

So I laughed.

Not the kind that lifts rooms or lights hearts—just a quiet, broken sound, escaping like steam from a pot too long forgotten. My hand moved up to rub the back of my neck, a useless motion, like I was trying to erase the moment from the space around me.

"Yeah," I said, voice rough. "You don’t have to say anything."

— Why did I lie?

I wanted her to say everything. I wanted her to crush me or save me—either would’ve been kinder than this slow dissolving.

Behind her, the late afternoon sun spilled through the window, painting the world gold, like a cruel joke. Everything looked too beautiful for what I was feeling.

“I should go,” I mumbled, even though I didn’t move. My shoes felt nailed to the floor. She gave the smallest nod, and that, somehow, hurt more than any word she could have spoken.

As I turned to leave, something caught in my chest. A breath that wouldn’t come. A feeling I couldn’t name.

The hallway outside felt longer than usual, like the building itself knew something had changed. I walked slowly, each step echoing back louder than it should, like I was being followed by the sound of my own heart breaking.

When I reached the end of the corridor, I paused.

— Don't cry. Not yet.

But I knew the moment would come—later, maybe, when I was alone. When the adrenaline had drained, and the silence had followed me all the way home. When I’d start to wonder if maybe she had said something, in a language my heart wasn’t fluent in.

And I’d replay the moment, again and again, hoping to hear the words I wanted.

They never came.

Not then.

Not later.

Not ever.
