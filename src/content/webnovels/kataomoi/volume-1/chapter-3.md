"We're back with sustenance!"

The door to the NEUROVERSE Lab slammed open with all the subtlety of a fire drill. 
I flinched, still wearing the HoloLens — digital flames dancing in the periphery of my vision.

Alfonse walked in like he owned the place, carrying two plastic bags that smells like heaven. 
Eduardo followed, cradling a half-melted pint of vanilla ice cream like it was a sacred relic, 
and somehow still has his usual deadpan expression.

"Hey, where's *my* ice cream?" I said, slipping off the headset.

"And someone better not have emotionally labeled this one too!"

"Pretty sure it was unlabeled," Edu muttered, already halfway to the freezer.

"I consulted the ancestors," Alfonse added solemnly, "We're in the clear."

Edu tucked his tub of vanilla goodness into the freezer with reverence of an offering.
Then he turned toward me.

"Anyway, you still alive in here?"

"Define alive."

I rubbed my temples.

"Fair enough."

The fire safety simulation had crashed again — something about a null reference in the particle system. 
The flames had spawned halfway across the globe, the extinguisher model floated off-screen and detonating for no reason like some virtual martyr.

I didn't want to talk about it.

We stood there in the fading orange glow of the lab: dim monitors, a tired overhead bulb, and winter dusk pressing in through the windows.

"I need food before I throw my laptop out the window," I announced.

Edu raised a brow. "Again?"

"It looked at me funny."

"Let's go," Alfonse said, already packing up. "We'll come back tomorrow to witness the holy ascension of the extinguisher again."

"Yeah, the particle system can crash without me for one night," I spoke defeatedly, grabbing my coat.

We bundled up and walked back across campus. 
Cold air bit at our ears adn fogged our breath.
Shuttered shops lined the pathways. 
Faded Global Fair posters flapped in the wind like forgotten promises.

Most of the campus was empty — homebound students long gone for the Lunar New Year. 
Those of us still here were stuck behind for one reason or another.
In our case: international student status, mandatory COVID testing and lockdowns, 
and an unwillingness to face the stress of applying for a temporary leave pass just to go outside the gate.

Leaving meant applying for leave. Coming back meant possibly being denied.

Inside the gates, we were safe.

Stuck, but safe.

By the time we reached Building 20, it was about eight forty-two in the evening.

Inside Room 208, the world was warm and cluttered. 
A faint smell of garlic from last someone made garlic bread.
And a pair of _Escapegoats_ that had technically become a permanent fixture on the couch.

Edu dropped his backpack in his bedroom with mechanical efficiency.

Alfonse disappeared into the kitchen like a foraging gremlin.

"Reminder," he called from inside the cooking lab, "nose-stabbing ritual tomorrow!"

I groaned. "Already?"

"Every three days," Edu chimed in. "Like clockwork. Or trauma."

Alfonse stuck his head out, holding a bowl. "I'm running out of unviolated nostrils."
He handed me the bowl — rice, soy-glazed beef, and a sunny-side up egg.

I stared at it like it owed me rent.

"Did you cook this?"

"No, this is _real_ food," he said. "We're saving the fusion experiments for breakfast."

"We don't *do* breakfast," Edu and I said in perfect sync without missing a beat.

Alfonse smiled like a proud father. "Exactly. No survivors."

We ate in comfortable silence. 
The kind that only comes after too many hours indoors, wrapped in the static of your own thoughts and codes.

"I still can't believe you two don't have to think about your dissertations yet," 
I muttered, curling into my chair like a caffeine-fueled cat in a sunbeam.

"Dissertations are a future problem," Edu said, picking a piece of browned beef from the rice bowl with his chopsticks.

"My future self can suffer," Alfonse followed. 
"Right now, I"m living in the present. Specifically the present where I add chili oil to everything I eat."

"You put it on your ice cream once!"

"And you _mocked_ me for innovation."

Silence.

Then laughter.

After dinner, Edu sprawled on the carpeted floor of his room with his tablet, farming materials in _Teyvris Saga_, an increasingly popular Anime-style gacha game.
Alfonse took his sketchpad and began drawing something vaguely humanoid with too many joints and what looked like a ladle for an arm.

I, true to form, brewed a fresh cup of coffee and claimed my usual perch on the armrest like a cat preparing to judge the room.

Edu side-eyed me, nose wrinkling. "How can you drink that stuff this late — or actually, at all?"

"Because my soul is black and bitter," I said. "And I have deadlines."

"Not tonight," he pointed out. "We're still on break. You're choosing violence."

"Correct."

He shook his head and returned to his virtual gacha hell.

The room quieted.

Just the low hum of the fridge, the faint buzzing of a monitor in one of the rooms, and distant pops of fireworks echoing down the corridor.

My phone buzzed. 

Campus group chat. 
Tomorrow's nucleic acid test at 8 a.m. 

No messages. 

Nothing personal.

There was no reason to expect anything.

— Still, I looked.

I locked the screen and slipped it under my leg.

I wasn't waiting. Not really.

Just... remembering.

Outside, the wind rustled through the dry trees like an old story. Somewhere outside, in the hallway, someone sneezed.

"Bless you!"

Alfonse finally sat up. "So. Anybody got plans for tomorrow?"

"COVID test," I said.

"Then breakfast?" he tried again.

"We d-"

“—don’t do breakfast, yeah, yeah,” he smirked. “Then what?”

“Nothing,” Edu sighed. He tapped his screen. Still no 5-star pull. “Maybe I’ll finish that inventory system before break ends.”

"Perfect."

"To Unity in confinement," Edu said.

"To questionable rice bowls," I added.

"To surviving tomorrow's stabbing," Alfonse finished.

We toasted. Coffee. Soda. Mysterious tea blend.

Just as I started melting into my post-rice coma, my phone buzzed again.
Different tone. Familiar vibration.

> [Lloyd]: Game night. Friday.

> [Lloyd]: Don't you dare ghost.

> [Lloyd]: You're coming.
 
I stared at the screen.

"Did you also get sentenced?" I asked aloud.

Edu and Alfonse looked up in unison.

I nodded.

Edu grinned. "Time to clear Friday night, and don't forget to bring your moral ambiguity."

"..That sounds _safe_."
