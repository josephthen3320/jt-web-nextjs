Morning came late. 

Technically, it wasn't even morning anymore.

A pale winter sun poured through the balcony windows of Room 208, casting a soft glow on chaos. 
The kitchen smelled faintly of yesterday's cookies and ambition.

The flat was quiet—aside from the sound of Edu on the dining table, still half asleep, 
head buried in his iPad filled with math scribbles, surrounded by four empty cans of Guarana Antarctica and one unopened 
hot sauce packet for reasons unknown. 

He lied face-down on the table clenching a graphic calculator on one hand like he'd fallen in battle mid-equation.
There was a pillow nearby in his room, untouched, as if he had considered comfort and then politely declined.

I emerged from my room, stretching like a stray cat that had lost a fight with notepad++.
My hoodie was wrinkled, my hair a vague suggestion of order, and my movements had the lazy precision of a feline navigating disaster with style.

I stood in front of the fridge, arms crossed, staring into the abyss like a cat judging an empty food bowl at three in the morning.

And it stared back.

"Nothing."

The fridge revealed a barren wasteland: two bottles of unidentified sauce, half a lemon, and a sad slice of cheese.
I closed the door slowly, respectfully, like saying goodbye to a disappointing friend.

"Try eating hope," Edu croaked from the dining table, not opening his eyes. "It's gluten-free."

I grabbed a piece of chocolate and cream biscuit from the emergency stash under my bed.
It was technically food.
It didn't contain banana nor squid, so that was a win.
Allergies and 'religious' reaons aside, I'd just developed an instinctive distrust toward anything yellow and cheerful in the morning.

The door to the leftmost room creaked open, and Alfonse stumbled out like a man emerging from a bunker.
Wrapped in a thick comforter, his hair a storm of slept-on regret, he blinked at the living room like he was unsure what decade it was.

"I had a dream," he said solemnly, in the kind of voice that prefaced either wisdom or nonsense.

"I was piloting a mech suit. It moved only when I filed my tax returns."

"Your subconscious wants you to pick a group work topic," I offered, biting into the biscuit.

"No, it wants me to suffer."

I handed him a mug of hot water. We were out of tea and most dreams. He took it like communion and sipped without complaint.

"By the way," a sound voiced out from the table, one eye now open and squinting.

"I think someone stole my last can of Guarana. It was labeled. Clearly."

"You labeled it?" I asked.

"I put emotional weight into it, that's labeling."

"Wasn't me... I think?"

They paused. Looked at me. 

I pretended not to notice their gaze and took the last piece of biscuit into my mouth.

Eventually, we moved like ghosts to get dressed. Layers were thrown on. 
Backpacks slung over shoulders. 
The usual hesitation at the door. 
None of us were morning people.
But there was work to be done.

The cold hit like a passive-aggressive slap. 
We trudged through campus, wind scraping at our ears and bones.
Alfonse had wrapped his scarf around his face like a post-apocalyptic wanderer.
Edu muttered calculus terms under his breath like warding spells.

By the time we reached the clock tower, fingers were numb and spirits half-frozen.
The NEUROVERSE Lab was located on the third floor, 
tucked away near the end of the corridor and a bulletin board so outdated 
it still advertised last semester's internship opportunities.

The name, in full, was "Neural Environment & User Research on Virtual Experience Simulation & Engagement,"
but most of us just called it "the lab with the expensive headsets and the immortal coffee-consuming resident cat."

As known only to members of the project, the last door could be opened without any key. Most of the time. 

The lab was warm — more from the heat of overheating laptops than any working thermostat. 
The warmth welcomed us, along with the comforting chaos of innovation: cables strewn like vines, base stations strategically placed like landmines waiting for the clumsy footstep of an unsuspecting undergrad, 
and the subtle hum of computers left on since last week.

Edu headed straight for Laptop 06 and opened it with a groan, Unity and SteamVR loading as if they were summoned to serve.

Alfonse migrated to the snack cart, opened it, and frowned. 

"Someone took the last good coffee bags."

"Maybe it was the same guy who stole my Guarana," 
Edu chimed in while working to make a play area on SteamVR. 

"I regret nothing."

I booted up my workstation and slipped on the HoloLens headset after curling briefly into the chair the way only cats and tired humans can.
My project — my dissertation, my insomnia machine, my personal demon — loaded into view.
A fire safety simulation, built for mixed reality.

The idea was simple: train people to act in emergencies using immersive cues, from locating extinguishers, killing the flames, and finding exits.

In practice, the fire spawned too close to the desk, the smoke particle floated sideways, and the virtual extinguisher model randomly explode and caused my app to crash.

"Looks legit," Edu said, looking at my monitor screen over my shoulder. "Like PTSD for introverts." 

Alfonse picked up a Vive controller — disconnected, of course — and began pretending to extinguish invisible fires. "Where's the panic button?"

"It's real life, you just scream."

He made a sound unlike a goat in distress.

The fire extinguisher model spawned in front of me — a feature I was proud of — only to immediately start floating away to oblivion, as if giving up on existence.

"Well, there goes my dignity and will to live."

We all burst into laughter. Edu laughed so hard he started gasping for air. Alfonse, similarly almost fell from his chair.

I sighed, smiling despite myself. 

"I swear. One more glitch and I'm going to actually set something on fire."

"You already did, no?" Edu said. "Digitally."

Seeing all the bugs, I decided to give up for the day and went over to Edu's station.
On his screen were a Unity scene containing a simulated aircraft crash site.
Edu was distracted trying to build an efficient inventory system that could save objects on the scene into it by pressing and holding the grip button.
Alfonse sketched an idea for a humanoid avatar model with roller skates, which he insisted was 'totally practical' for quick response.
I tinkered with spatial mapping and got the virtual assistant character to behave... mostly.

By around 6 p.m., they both left to fetch dinner and daylight from the campus gate.

— I stayed.

The lab was different in the evenings — quieter, slower, like a clock ticking just for me. 
The headset sat on the desk, its lights blinking in a steady rhythm like the eyes of some digital feline, quietly watching.
The warmth of their presence faded, and I was alone again, surrounded by code, cables, and that odd, familiar ache in my chest.

I checked my phone without thinking.

Part of me expected a message. Like a cat watching the door long after everyone has left.

— The photo was still there.

A group photo from the trip. She stood off next to me, ever so slightly leaning to me while tiptoeing trying to match my height.
There was something timeless about the image, like it didn't belong to any specific hour — just to memory.

I hadn't heard from her since we did not even mention our names to each other.

I stared at the image until my eyes unfocused.

Outside, sounds of occasional footsteps. Soft. Slow. Gentle.

I turned off the lights in the room, slipped on the headset one more time.

The simulation booted.

Digital flames flickered — artificial, coded, and somehow colder than memory. 
Smoke curled upward. The extinguisher stood silently, waiting.

The real fire was a glance, a lean, a photo I never meant to treasure. 

I walked through the program again.

No alarms. No instructions. Just the low hum of digital fire, and the quiet rhythm of my breath in my ears.

There were exits in the code.

— But none of them were real.

As I was just about to get lost in the data, the door abruptly slammed open.

"We're back with sustenance!"

— They are real.

"Hey, where's my ice cream?! — And someone better not have emotionally labeled this one too."
