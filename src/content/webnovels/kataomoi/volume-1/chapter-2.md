The wind hit like a slap as I stepped off the bus — cold, wet, and absolutely not winter nor springlike, no matter what the calendar insisted.
My legs were half-asleep from the ride, and I was fumbling with the zipper of my coat when I heard it.

"Hey."

I turned.

There was a petite girl standing just behind me on the bus steps. 
Her black hair spilling down to her chest, slightly flushed cheeks—not from embarrassment, as I'd later found out, but from a far more traumatic cause.

She looked me dead in the eyes and said, completely matter-of-fact:

"I just puked in the coach."


I blinked.

"...congratulations?"


She stared at me for half a second, then bursts out laughing.

"Thanks. I was going for a personal best."


There's something disarming about the way she said it—like she'd already processed the horror, filed it away, and decided to turn it into a personality trait.
I had no idea what to say, so I just laughed along. 

— What else could I do, really?

She stepped off behind me, landing with a bit of a wobble.
"Don't worry," she added casually, "I aimed for the floor, not the seats. You're safe."

— Comforting

"Really builds trusts between us, huh." I said.


She glanced sideways, as if only now realising we hadn't formally met. 

"Did you happen to be at the gym last night? You were with a friend using the mat area, right?"

Taken by surprise, I nodded slowly and said, "Yeah, how'd you know?"

"I knew it, you look familiar!" She continued. 

She pulled her hood up and shivered. "I'm cold. And mildly dying. Let's get going and find somewhere warm."

And that was it.

We didn't exchange names. We just started walking. 

The rest of the trip participants were already gathering near the village gate, forming loose clumps of noise and energy.
Somewhere, the trip organiser was yelling instructions and being universally ignored.

The village we'd arrived at was tiny—like someone had plucked it out of a documentary and dropped it in the mountains.
Old wooden houses, narrow dirt paths, and smoke curling from a chimney like something out of a folktale.

Everything smelled faintly of earth, wood, and food I didn't recognise.

"Smells like tofu," she said, sniffing the air. "Or feet."

"Is there a difference?"

"Depends on the feet."

We spent the morning rotating through the different cultural activities.

First, the **popcorn cannon** — a rusted metal tube that looks more like a miniature medieval weapon than a snack-making device.
An old man shouted warnings in the local dialect, yanked a steel bar, and the thing exploded with a *BANG* that nearly sent her stumbling into me.

She jumped, smacked my arm, and muttered, "I knew I'm going to die on this trip."

"Don't worry, If you puke again, I'll avenge you."

Next was **candy making** — we twisted sugar into shapes with trembling fingers, hers a lopsided rabbit, mind an accidental slime.
She looked at mine and grinned.

"It's like an exhausted rabbit."

"Just like me," I said. 

She laughed hard enough that her nausea came back and turned her fair complexion green.

"Oh no," she clutched her stomach like it was plotting against her. 

"I think the egg I had for breakfast finally declared a second war."

I looked at her with what I hoped was concern, but probably came out closer to alarm.

"Do you need to—"

"Don't say the word," she cut me off, holding a finger with great dramatic weight.

"If I hear the word, I *will* reenact it."

— Duly noted.

One of the trip captain noticed her wilting and guided her toward the 'dining room' 
— a drafty wooden hall at the side of the village with a suspicious number of plastic chairs stacked in a corner.
If we could call it a restaurant, it was out of sheer generosity and not because any signage confirmed it.

She plumped into the nearest bench, hand still over her stomach like a tragic noblewoman struck down in her prime.

"I'm going to die here," she mumbled. "In a tofu-stained coat, surrounded by strangers and soybeans."

"At least you'll be remembered," I said. I'll write a eulogy. Something tasteful, perhaps even rhyme it with 'fermented bean curd.'"

"*Beautiful*," she groaned.

"Just make sure to bury me next to the popcorn cannon. I want to go out with a *bang* for sure."

I sat across from her, watching as she leaned against the wooden table and closed her eyes. For a moment, she looked peaceful—pale, yes, but peaceful.

“Do you want water? Or warm soy milk, maybe?” I offered.

“I want reincarnation,” she replied without opening her eyes.

“Coming right up.”

I returned with a paper cup of lukewarm water, which she accepted like a relic from a holy shrine. “You have my eternal gratitude,” she whispered, sipping with great ceremony.

Outside the window, I could see the others trying calligraphy now, hunched over ink and paper like students in a scene from an old samurai film. 
One of them had already splashed black ink all over his coat. 
Another was apparently trying to draw a Pokémon instead of writing the Chinese characters.

“I wanted to do the brush thing,” she said after a moment, eyes still half-shut. “But not if my stomach is going to perform interpretive dance in the middle of it.”

“You can draw a spiral,” I said. “Symbolic. Like life.”

“Like my digestion.”

We both laughed—softer this time.

The dining hall creaked as the wind pushed against it. 
Somewhere, a kettle whistled faintly. 
The air smelled of tofu, ink, and cold wood.

And in that moment, despite the nausea, the bad eggs, and the sheer absurdity of the day, I realized I didn’t mind sitting here.

Just like this.

With her.
