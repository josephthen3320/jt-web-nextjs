“I just needed you to know,” 

I said, not looking up. 

Her silence didn’t fall like thunder—it fell like snow. 

Quiet, cold, and slow to melt.


She didn’t answer right away. 
The silence stretched, thick and suffocating, like the pause before a storm. 
My heart pounded in my ears, and I could almost hear the rhythm of my breath against the beating pulse of the world.


I glanced up at her, but she wasn’t looking at me. 

Her gaze was somewhere far off, distant like a horizon I could never reach. 
I thought I saw a flicker in her eyes—a hesitation, maybe, but it disappeared before I could be sure.

“I don’t expect anything from this,” 

I added quickly, trying to swallow the lump that had formed in my throat. 


"I just... had to say it. For me."

The words hung there, unanswered. 

Her lips parted, but only a breath escaped, not a reply. 
And in that moment, I knew. 
The space between us had changed, but not in the way I’d hoped.

I wanted to reach out, to pull the words back, but I couldn’t. 

— It was too late.

Her gaze finally met mine. 
It wasn’t the look I wanted, but it wasn’t the rejection I’d feared either. 

It was something softer. 

Something quieter.

— And it stung.

“I...” 

She didn’t finish, only looked away again, the words unspoken and hanging in the air, fragile like glass.
