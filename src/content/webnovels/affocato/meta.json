  "author": "Kurogane Nara",
  "description": "Some people survive on structure. Ren survives on instant noodles, overdue laundry, and a catastrophic amount of coffee. Drifting through the soft chaos of young adulthood, he navigates mismatched furniture, glitchy code, long silences, and friends who somehow make the world feel less impossible. Days blur. Nights stretch. And somewhere between game nights and grocery runs, something small starts to shift. Affocato is a slice-of-life novel about liminal seasons, caffeinated coping, and the quiet, awkward beauty of being almost okay.",
