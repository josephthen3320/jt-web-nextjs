— The sky couldn't decide what season it wanted to be.

I can't help to think that as the wind hit like a slap the moment I stepped out of the coach.
Humid, indecisive wind that couldn't quite commit to being summer of autumn.

September light filtered through half-hearted clouds. My suitcase thumped along the asphalt ground like it was already regretting the journey.
Every building looked like it had copied its neighbour's homework — blank, grey-gaced, and vaguely hostile to orientation.

I was here. Finally.

Induction Week. New university. New city. Familiar country.

And I was already lost.

"Building 20," I muttered, scanning the row of identical grey blocks.

"Where are you, you elusive concrete bastard?"

Buildings 18 through 22 were supposedly in a row, but the campus layout seemed more like an inside joke than a navigable space.
A student volunteer in a neon vest waved me over, shouting something about "new student registration" in rapid Mandarin-inflected half-English.

Twenty minutes later, I had finally found hope. 

Special thanks to a kind stranger that approached me as I was quizzically tilting my head, and the campus map.
Funnily enough, I was just stood by facing the direction of the building in question. 
How did I miss the comically large "Building 20" signage above the entrance eludes me — perhaps only the universe has the answer to that. 

The walk to the dorm was short, but my suitcase had a vendetta.
I rolled it over tiled paths, past students carrying luggage, care packages, and IKEA furniture like warrior monks.

Here at last. I went in to the reception desk and filled out the residency contract.

I had now on me, a bag of welcome leaflets I would never read, a copy of the residency agreement, an AC remote, a checklist of room equipments, and a short guide to living in campus.

Building 20. Room 208.

A number and a door. That was home now.

---

The dorms were plain concrete blocks, softened slightly by the line of ginkgo trees outside.
Building 20 looked like every other residence building I passed, except for a slightly torn poster taped to the glass door that read 
"**No loud music after 11 PM (We mean it this time). Signed Hall Tutors.**"

Inside, the air was cooler and smelled faintly of detergent and smoke.

Room 208 was on the second floor. 
The elevator wheezed its way up with all the enthusiasm of an ancient machine that had witnessed too many freshman breakdowns.
The hallway was narrow, quiet, and barely looks clean — no thanks to the dark red bricks they had used for the floor tilings.

The flat had four bedrooms positioned in a row, in addition to a shared common area with a kitchenette, small dining table, and a fridge that hummed like it had secrets.

One of the bedroom doors was closed. 
The other three were open.
Mine was labeled 208-3, third room from the left.

I unlocked it, stepped inside, and took a slow breath.

It was small, clean, impersonal — bed, desk, wardrobe, window. A single chair.
White walls that looked one existential crisis away from being scratched poetry.

But it was mine.

I spent the next hour unpacking, slowly, inefficiently.

Mostly I stared at objects and wondered how they'd fit into this new life.

A few clothes. Notebooks. A half-empty bottle of melatonin.
Laptop and charger. Instant coffee I wasn't proud of. 
A tiny plush hamster I never admitted to owning.

Eventually, I made a to-do list:
* New student registration (get the student ID!)
* Residence permit paperwork
* Open a local bank account
* Figure out if the hot water works
* Internet!

I stepped out of my room and into a scene I wasn't expecting.

There in the common area, sat three people - clearly a family - halfway through a conversation I didn't understand.
Spanish? No. Portuguese, I thought. The rhythm of it was light, melodic, laced with just enough sharpness to feel lived-in.

The father stood by the doorway of the room next to mine. 
The mother sat closest to where the father was standing, was quietly straightening a stack of papers beside a half-unpacked tote bag.
And beside her, arms resting on the table, was a boy - midway through his teenage years, hoodie pulled half over his face as he stared down at his phone like it owed him answers.

And across them, seated with a bottle of water, was the only one who looked like he belonged: NASA hoodie, simple crew-cut hair, presence just quiet enough to blend into the off-white walls.

Our eyes met.

"Oh," he said, sitting up straighter. "Room 3?"

"Yeah. Just moved in. Ren."

He offered his hand, and I took it.

"Eduardo. Room next to yours. Most people call me Edu." His voice was calm - not quiet, just... careful.
Measured, like someone who picked his words deliberately.

His handshake was calm. The kind that didn't try too hard - like he knew this wasn't a moment that needed to be made bigger than it was.

His father gave me a brief nod. 
His mother acknowledged me with a polite smile before returning to fussing over the younger boy who was still tapping something I couldn't quite see on his phone.

I shifted awkwardly for a moment, then gestured at the table.
"I was going to head out. Got a few errands still to do."

Edu raised an eyebrow. "The Nexus?"

I nodded. "You too?"

"Yeah. Still need to finish the new student registration stuff."

He glanced toward his parents, who were already starting to collect their things, as if they'd been waiting for this moment.
His mother said something to him in Portuguese, her tone soft but a little firm - motherly concern compressed into syllables I didn't quite catch.
He answered in the same language, briefly, gently.

They moved with a kind of wordless choreography, packing without hurry but without waste.

Edu turned back to me. "Give me a second. I'll come with you."

He disappeared into his room. A few moments later, he returned with a slim backpack and a phone in his hand.

"I haven't got my student card yet," he said as we slipped our shoes on near the flat door.
"So no hot water test yet for me."

"Same," I said. "Apparently we'll get it after submitting the registration form."

"Fun."

As we stepped outside, the corridor air was cool, laced with that crisp-sweet scent of ginkgo and fresh paint.

We walked in comfortable silence until we reached the bridge connecting the living area and what I assumed was the teaching area.
A short walk from the bridge was the Riverside Building - RB for short, as I later learnt. 
Students were streaming in and out of the entrance like the building was breathing them.

Edu adjusted the strap of his bag and spoke again, casual.

"You already have a phone number?"

"Yeah. I did high school here. Different city, though."

He nodded. "Same. My dad sorted mine out before I flew. Chinese ID helps. I don't speak the language, though. So..."

He trailed off with a small shrug, like that explained everything.

I laughed. "Yeah, I've been pretending I understand way more than I do."

"That's the international student experience."

He didn't say it bitterly. Just as a fact. Like jet lag or overpriced chocolate.

I glanced sideways. He had that kind of face - in his country, probably seen as Asian. 
Here, probably mistaken for anything but local. 
I recognised that expression. The internal math of always kind of belonging and kind of not.

I was the same.

"I get it," I said.

He looked at me again - not with surprise, but with something a little more grounded. A click.

"You're a scholarship student?" I asked.

"Yeah. Government scholarship."

"Nice."

"Still figuring out how to afford the vending machines, though."

He grinned at that, quick and sharp.

We passed through the entrance of the Riverside Building and the air conditioning hit like a corporate dream.
Inside, everything was sterile, bright, and humming with administrative chaos.
Lines snaked in every direction.
People holding papers looked increasingly unmoored.

Edu looked around. "This place gives off DMV energy."

"We're all just queueing to become real students," I muttered.

"I didn't know purgatory had a front desk."

I smirked.

Together, we stepped into the line in _The Nexus_.
