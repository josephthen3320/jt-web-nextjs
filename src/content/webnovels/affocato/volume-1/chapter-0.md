It happened just past three in the morning.

I was on the floor again—cross-legged in the dark, surrounded by wires, receipts, and half-spilled thoughts. 
The only light came from my laptop screen, still open to a Unity error I no longer had the energy to fix. 
Cold coffee sat beside me, untouched. 
The room smelled faintly of dust and burnt buttered toast.

I wasn’t working. Not really.

Just avoiding sleep.

Some people hear voices when they’re alone at night. 
I just hear everything else. 
The hum of the fridge when it decides to matter. 
The tick of the alarm clock, five seconds behind real time. 
The strange phantom drip in the sink that only starts after midnight.

That night, even the fridge had given up. 
Everything was holding its breath.

And then I saw it.

— A cat.

Perched on the railing of my tiny balcony. 
Perfectly still. 
Watching.

Its fur was black—or something darker than black. 
Like a shadow that remembered being light.

Its eyes caught none of the light, but shimmered like they knew me.

I didn’t even think. 
I slid the door open.

Cold air spilled into the room, sharp and biting. 
My hoodie was too thin, my socks unmatched, but none of that mattered. 
The cat didn’t flinch. 
Didn’t blink. 
It just looked at me, like it was waiting.

Not for food. Not for warmth.

For something else.

“You’re not real,” I whispered.

The cat tilted its head.

And for a second, I wondered if it was thinking the same about me.

We stared at each other, two ghosts of two different kinds. 
I couldn’t tell if I was holding my breath or if it had already left me. 
The world was so quiet, it felt staged—like someone had muted everything except this moment.

Then the cat moved.

Not toward me. 
Not into the flat.
It leapt downward—off the railing and into the dark.

— Gone.

No sound. No shape. Just... gone.

I rushed to the edge and looked over, but the alley below was empty. 
Just frost on cement. 
A few stray cigarette butts. 
Silence returning like a tide.

I stayed up the rest of the night.

Tried to work. Didn’t. 

Tried to journal. Failed. 

Ended up staring at the ceiling while my mug sat untouched beside me.

And when morning came, pale and sour, I dragged myself toward the window and froze.

There—on the glass door to the balcony—were pawprints.

Small. Smudged. Four steps. Like it had walked halfway to coming inside and changed its mind.

Faint.

And impossible.

I pressed my fingers to the marks, just to be sure. 
They didn’t smear. Didn’t disappear. 
The glass was cold, but something in me warmed—sharply, suddenly—like a wire sparking back to life.

I didn’t know what the cat wanted.

I still don’t.

But ever since that night, I’ve felt like something’s been following me. 
Not in the way that makes you look over your shoulder. 

— Not exactly.

More like a scent you keep noticing, a pattern you almost recognize, a dream you can’t tell from memory.

And coffee doesn't help.

Not with this.
